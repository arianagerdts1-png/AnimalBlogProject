                    For new puppy owners, life can feel amazing for the first few days of owning a puppy, until after a few days it finally hits:<i style="font-size:medium; font-style: italic;"> what have I gotten myself into? </i>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Between proper feeding, behavioral control, and the constant bombardment of advice you have probably gotten from friends and family, it can be extremely overwhelming. Luckily, knowing these 3 tips will help you become a better dog owner and get you through the next few months.

                <p>
                    It’s easy to feel like now that you own a dog, it is your responsibility to make him perfect - like he has to be trained, know 50 tricks, never bark, and never make any mistakes. 
                    However, contrary to the TikTok or Instagram trainers you might have seen across the internet, puppies are still learning how to be dogs. They chew, they bark, they make messes, and that’s normal. 
                    It’s like expecting a toddler to never cry. Once they grow up, you hope that they won’t cry unnecessarily, and this also applies to your new pup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best thing you can do in these first few months is to set realistic expectations. Focus on small wins: teaching your puppy to sit, rewarding calm behavior, and helping him adjust to your home. 
                    Celebrate the little wins instead of perfection. Remember, patience now will pay off later - the bond you build during this stage is far more important than a flawless performance.

                <p>
                    A new puppy can easily be overwhelmed moving from their parents' comfort to a new home, and the best way to make a puppy feel comfortable is to establish a routine day to day. 
                    Young puppies thrive on consistency, whether it be the same morning breakfast at 9 a.m., or an afternoon walk after work. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting regular times for feeding, potty breaks, play, and sleep can make the transition to living with you a lot smoother. 
                    Creating a schedule for yourself, such as a consistent morning routine that includes activities with your furry friend, can be tremendously helpful to later success with your puppy.

                    <p style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">Socialize early</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    One of the most important things you can do for your puppy is to help him feel comfortable in the world. Socialization means introducing your puppy to new people, 
                    places, sounds, and experiences in a positive way. A well-socialized puppy grows into a confident dog who is less likely to develop fear or aggression later on.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Start small: invite a calm friend over, let your puppy sniff around, and reward him with treats for relaxed behavior. Take short walks in different 
                    environments so he hears cars, sees bicycles, and meets neighbors. Always keep these experiences gentle and controlled — you don’t want to overwhelm him. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of socialization as building your puppy’s “life toolbox.” Each positive encounter adds a tool that helps him handle future situations with ease. 
                    The safer, happier experiences he has now, the better prepared he’ll be for the big world ahead.
                </p>

                    <p style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Owning a puppy is certainly a roller coaster in the first few months, but hopefully, incorporating these tips into your daily life will help make life feel less stressful. 
                    Remember: no matter how overwhelming it can feel, you’re making a best friend that you will remember for the rest of your life. 
                    The next few years will be filled with laughter, learning, and unconditional love, and every challenge along the way will be worth it.

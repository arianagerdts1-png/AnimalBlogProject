                    If you have ever had the thought about getting a dog but are worried about them not fitting into the family, well, I'm here to tell you the perfect dog breeds for you and your family. There are numerous reasons why someone might be hesitant to get a dog. Maybe you have young children and don't want the risk of them getting hurt, maybe you have another pet that might get into arguments with the dog, or maybe you are worried since you travel a lot. These are all valid points; however, there's a dog for everyone's home — you just have to find the right one.

                    <p style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">Labrador Retriever</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The first dog on our list is the Labrador Retriever, America's most popular breed for decades! They are oftentimes recognized for their friendly and outgoing nature. These are the dogs you could categorize as a man's best friend, yet still have the ability to be a tickle monster to your kids. They have short, dense, water‑repellent double coats and come in three different colors: black, yellow, or chocolate. The Labrador is a great dog for your family if you love being active outdoors; they love to swim, hike, and run. They generally live for about 10–12 years, so you are able to spend quite a bit of time with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, if you aren't an active family, these dogs can get bored and have destructive behaviors. As well as the fact they are a medium‑large dog breed, meaning if you aren't able to withhold 55–80 pounds, a smaller dog would be a better choice. Lastly, these dogs need regular grooming since their double coats shed often; however, brushing once a day should do the trick.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">Poodle</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The second dog on our list is the Poodle. These dogs are highly intelligent and are easily trained if you are worried about potty training or tricks. These dogs are best known for their curly, low‑shedding coats, making them an excellent choice for those who may suffer from allergies. The Poodle makes an amazing guard dog and an amazing family dog since they are often playful, friendly, and alert. These dogs also come in three different sizes, meaning if you are unable to withhold a larger dog, you could get the miniature or toy Poodle. If you are an active or playful family, this dog would be the best choice for you since they love walks, jogs, and fetch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, if you are not an active family, I would look for another dog who may need less attention. On the note of attention, due to their thick curly coat, they need professional grooming to prevent matting of their hair every 4–6 weeks. Lastly, they tend to be more prone to certain conditions like hip dysplasia and eye issues.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">American Bulldog</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Lastly, the third dog on our list is the American Bulldog. These little potatoes are a very docile companion, making it a popular family dog, as well as their affectionate and good‑natured personality. The Bulldog is a short, medium‑sized dog with a wrinkled face and short snout. They, despite their build, require minimal exercise; however, overdoing the exercise can cause major health problems due to breathing challenges, especially in the heat. So if your family is not so active yet has the time to take this loving dog on a brisk walk, then this dog is the one for your family. Their coats are short and fine with minimal shedding and no excessive brushing needed, but they do need their skin folds regularly cleaned to prevent skin infections and debris getting caught.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although this dog seems like the perfect dog for your family, it is important to know the health problems that arise with this breed. They are oftentimes prone to issues related to their short snouts, such as breathing difficulties, and gain weight very easily. These make their lifespan quite short, only living for about 8–10 years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If any of these dog breeds seem like the perfect fit for your family, then don't hesitate to give them a loving home!
